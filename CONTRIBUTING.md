# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for taking the time to contrbiute to SQLlion! Please follow these simple guidelines to ensure your contribution is helpful and loved by all. Before doing anything, check out SQLlion's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure everyone is happy.

## Found a bug or though of a new feature?
* Ensure that nobody else has done the same by checking out SQLlion's [Issues](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/issues) page.
* If not, [create a new Issue](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/issues/new) using one of the following templates, if applicable:

  * [Basic Bug Report Template](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
  * [Basic Feature Enhancement Template](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) 
  
## Found a fix for a bug or integration of a feature?
* Again, ensure that nobody else has done the same by reviewing SQLlion's [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/pulls) page.
* If not, create a new Pull Request using the [following template](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Looking to fix a cosmetic feature?
* Go ahead! We all have a little to learn though: ensure you explain your decision when you create a Pull Request and give advice for future improvements!
* Try to do all cosmetic adjustments in one fell swoop: too many clutter the [history](https://github.com/ThomasFrew/SQLlion/network) of the network: obscuring otherwise useful branches.
